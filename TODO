0)  Test with multiple metasploitables each running 3-6 services (find windowx xp box?)
1)  Solidify the "search" in metasploit if possible
2)  Allow user to pass parameters (payloads to try, times to wait, exploit rank, criticality of system, exploit rank etc.)
3)  Implement a bruteforce on common ports if exploitation using modules was not successful
4)  Comment code
5)  Move things to function (time permitting)
