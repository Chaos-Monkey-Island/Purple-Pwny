1)  Implement a bruteforce on common ports if exploitation using modules was not successful
2)  Allow user to pass parameters (payloads to try, times to wait, exploit rank, criticality of system, exploit rank etc.)
3)  Solidify the "search" in metasploit if possible
4)  find window xp box?
5)  Comment code
6)  Move things to functions (time permitting)
